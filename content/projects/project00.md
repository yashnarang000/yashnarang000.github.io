Mini projects that actually do something—react, respond, and move. No simulations—real circuits, real outcomes. From sensors that sense to motors that move, every project here is a test of control, precision, and stubborn curiosity.

This isn’t lab work. It’s problem-solving in its rawest form—code meeting copper, logic powering action. If it doesn’t work, I fix it. If it does, I push it further.
