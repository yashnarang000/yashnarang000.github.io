Ever wanted to send secret messages that only you and your friends can understand? NCryptor is a fun encryption tool I built that turns your regular messages into mysterious coded text. Just type in what you want to say, hit encrypt, and boom â€“ you get a secret code to share. Your friend downloads the same app, pastes the code, hits decrypt, and reads your message. It's like having your own secret language for chatting without anyone else knowing what you're talking about. Perfect for when you want to keep things between you and your crew.
*Built with Python*
