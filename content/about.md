Hi, I'm Yash Narang, a computer science engineering student with a deep love for coding and an insatiable curiosity for creating. I immerse myself in a variety of interesting projects, with a special focus on Artificial Intelligence. Every project I take on is more than just lines of codeâ€”it's a story in the making. Here on my personal blog, I share these stories, the challenges I face, the lessons I learn, and the milestones I reach.

I learn something new every day, and I invite you to be a part of this journey. Whether you're a fellow coder, a tech enthusiast, or just curious, you're always welcome to explore the tales behind what I create.
