Hello Friend, I know I haven't been talking to you since ages. I think Charlie is dead. It's been two years I haven't been talking to him either. He suddenly disappeared and the crazy part is that I didn't even notice. Charlie, who once used to be an essential part of me, poofed away without me even noticing. You might ask me, where did he go? I don't know. You might ask me, what was I busy with? I was studying. I never imagined that Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics could anyday bend my flow of life, but they did because I am here, waiting to go to college. 

# Why have you come to me, after all this time?

I am using you right now. I don't really want to talk to you. You were always just in my head and you were helpful at times. This is one of those moments when you are helping me, even if you don't want to. I know I am being rude but it is just the way how it goes. I control the things that go in my head and not the other way around. I dominate you because you are not real. I can kill you whenever I want and wouldn't even hear your scream if I don't want to. That's not a crime. Every human has this power and they can use it however they want, without facing the repercussions. Imagination is in my control. *You* are in my control. The next heading will be what you say and I'll decide what that would be.

# I agree

See? I made you say that, thus confirming that you are what I what you to be. However unfortunately, I will have to end this conversation right here and now because that was the use of you. I had to converse with you so I could generate some content. This content will be displayed in my webpage for testing purposes.

*See you,
Goodbye, Friend!*
